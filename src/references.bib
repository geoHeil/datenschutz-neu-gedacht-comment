            Against the backdrop of an evolving landscape describing data driven research, this article discusses the role of data protection laws in shaping a free flow of research data. In particular, the analysis inquires whether European data protection law hampers or encourages data-driven research. The analysis critically challenges the shared belief that the more severe data protection regime laid down by the European legislator adversely affects data flows and with that data-driven research. This is contrary to what occurs in the United States, where the more fragmented and less developed data protection framework facilitates data flows and related innovation patterns. We show how research objectives through data re-usability have been very recently given primary importance in the GDPR, where they find a formidable ally enabling the re-usability of public data by businesses and of private data by public institutions, for either public interest-related research purposes or commercially oriented innovation purposes. We argue that the GDPR differently promotes research-valuable data flows in consistency with an emerging principle of free movement of personal data. In order to ground this statement, our analysis links to this principle three-directional research regimes emerging from the GDPR.},

Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures, parameter counts, and training datasets. The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for classification and attribute inference.},
