# Introduction

In an age dominated by the paradigm of data as gold, the GDPR has gained prominence among regulations - cherished and reviled at once, and emulated often enough to give rise to the term "Brussels effect".
Christiane Wendehorst's revisiting of the legal text, with the intention of simplifying compliance (especially for SMEs), adapting it to the realities of AI development, while at the same time enhancing Fundamental Rights protections, is a highly timely intervention.

In the following, we examine Wendehorst's draft text from the perspective of an SME engaged in developing and deploying AI technologies.
We ask some clarification questions regarding concepts introduced in the text, and then take a deep dive into the technicalities of implementing some of the requirements, discussing technical challenges, describing potential pitfalls, and suggesting possible solutions.
